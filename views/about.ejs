    <b style="font-size: larger;">Hey there ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Ramzin!</b> <br><br>

Iâ€™m currently doing my B.Tech in IT at CUSAT, and this blog is my space to share the ups and downs of learning, coding, and figuring things out as I go. Think of it as a mix of a diary, a resource hub, and a personal project showcase.

Iâ€™m super interested in web development right nowâ€”starting with frontend, moving into backend, and slowly working towards becoming a full-stack developer. Along the way, Iâ€™ll also share side projects, experiments, and maybe even a few random thoughts that pop into my head.

Outside of tech, I love gaming, exploring creative ideas, and sometimes just chilling with friends or binge-watching shows. I like to keep things simple, fun, and real.

If youâ€™ve stumbled onto my blog, welcome! I hope you find something here that inspires you, makes you smile, or maybe even helps you in your own journey. ðŸŒ±
